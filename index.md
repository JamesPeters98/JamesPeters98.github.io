### Java Projects 

[Minecraft Spigot Plugin - Chests++](https://github.com/JamesPeters98/ChestsPlusPlus)

This is my largest personal project in Java, which makes use of the Bukkit/Spigot plugin api to create modifcations to the Minecraft server experience. The plugin is quite in depth and adds a range of features such as 'linking' Chests over infinite distances and worlds, filtering chests using Hoppers and Auto-Crafting - along with a range of other useful features.

Some key tools used in this project include:

1. A custom Travis CI workflow - since some plugins require access to public methods in the Minecraft source code the plugin must be built against a decompiled Minecraft source, this source cannot be distributed and therefore must be decompiled directly on the CI server itself. To achieve this I had to modify the BuildTools project that is normal used to decompile the source code so that it would only decompile new source code if changes were detected in the git repo. This change was made in this [PR](https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT/repos/buildtools/commits/19d26b6581b57fdb0b75577c32fd525c4371860e).
